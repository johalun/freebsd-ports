Sway was created to fill the need of an i3-like window manager for Wayland.
The upstream i3 developers have no intention of porting i3 to Wayland, and
projects proposed by others ended up as vaporware. Many thanks to the i3
folks for providing such a great piece of software, so good that your users
would rather write an entirely new window manager from scratch that behaved
exactly like i3 rather than switch to something else. Launch sway directly
from a tty or via your favorite Wayland-compatible login manager.
